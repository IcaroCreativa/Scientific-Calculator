# Scientific-Calculator
Python Calculator with Tkinter
This simple calculator was created using Python and the Tkinter library. It includes basic mathematical functions, as well as the ability to calculate square roots, sines, cosines, and tangents.

## Technology
<img src="https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-inkscape.svg" width="90" alt="Python Logo"> Version 3.11.1
## Usage
To use this calculator, simply open the main.py file in your Python interpreter. You should see a calculator window pop up, which will allow you to enter calculations using Polish notation.

## Notes
Polish notation was used for mathematical calculations to simplify the calculation process.
To ensure security and accuracy of calculations, the exec and eval functions were intentionally avoided.
This calculator was developed in a single day of work as part of my training at EPITECH school.
